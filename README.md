# Zoom Connector for ConnID and Midpoint


## Overview

Open source Identity Management connector for [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) that uses the [ConnId](https://connid.tirasa.net/) framework.

This software also leverages the [Connector Base Framework](https://github.com/ExclamationLabs/connector-base). It is developed and tested with [Midpoint](https://evolveum.com/midpoint/), but also could be utilized with systems that implement the [ConnId](https://connid.tirasa.net/) framework.

This software is Copyright 2020-2024 Exclamation Graphics.  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Connector versions 4.0.1 and above support OAuth2 for authentication. Prior JWT authentication is no longer supported by Zoom.


## Features



* The connector configuration can be specified in the midPoint user interface or it can be read from a property file.
* The connector supports Zoom Meeting User, Zoom Phone Users, and Zoom Groups
* The connector can Create, Update, Delete, and search Zoom users.
* The connector can enable the Zoom Phone Feature for active Zoom Users.
* The connector can Assign or Unassign Calling Plans, Phone Numbers, Company Site, and Extension Number to an enabled Zoom Phone User account
* The connector can Create, Update, Delete, and List Zoom Groups.
* A User can be associated or disassociated with one or more Zoom Groups
* The list of Zoom Users can be searched by one of three statuses (active, inactive, pending)
* The connector will download users with all statuses by default unless a status is specified in the search criteria.
* The connector configuration will allow you to select whether a user to be deactivated, disassociated, or deleted when the Zoom User delete operation is invoked.


## Caveats



* Connector operation requires that you have at least a Zoom Pro Account. See [https://zoom.us/pricing](https://zoom.us/pricing) for more information.
* Basic Free Zoom accounts have rate limits which prevent normal operation of the connector. See [https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/rate-limits/](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/rate-limits/) for more information.
* The connector currently supports the default create user action. We expect _custCreate_, _autoCreate_, and _ssoCreate_ to be available in a future release.
* The default create action is to set the user in pending status until activation is complete.
* The default create action requires the user to activate their zoom account by verifying their email address. Until activation is completed the account remains in 'pending' status.
* When a user is in a 'pending' status, the connector can use the API to lookup a user by ID or email address. However, the data returned is minimal or empty.
* A user’s information cannot be updated when the status is pending.
* A user’s information can be updated and retrieved when the status is active.
* A user’s information can be retrieved but not updated when the status is inactive
* A user’s information can only be updated when the account is activated or reactivated.


# Getting started

To begin you will need to register and activate at least a Zoom Pro account.  with one or more licenses for Zoom User and/or Zoom Phone. A normal Zoom account with zero licenses will not operate properly because of [rate limits](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/rate-limits/).  \


You can manage Users and Groups in Zoom's web UI by going to [https://zoom.us/meeting](https://zoom.us/meeting) and using the Admin -> User Management links. The owner of the account or a user with **Admin** role is required to create the Server to Server OAuth application in the Zoom marketplace.

\
See [https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop) for information on setting up a Zoom developer account. Once you are authenticated, create a new [Server-Server OAuth](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/s2s-oauth/) app as documented here [https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create/](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create/)


## Zoom Oauth2 Scopes

The following OAuth Scopes will be required in the Server to Server OAuth Application in order to use this connector.



* group:master
* group:read:admin,
* group:write:admin
* phone:master
* phone:read:admin
* phone:write:admin
* user:master
* user:read:admin
* user:write:admin


# Connector configuration

The actual method of configuring a connector is largely dependent on the interface(s) provided by your Identity and Access management system. Midpoint provides a convenient user interface method to enter these values. If configuration properties are being read in from a property file you may also need to know the name of the property.


## Configuration Parameters

The configuration parameters are specified in the following table. One thing to watch out for is the setting for the OAuth2 client secret when using the midpoint interface. You should collapse the configuration

# Connector Operations

The Zoom connector implements the following connId SPI operations:



* **SchemaOp** - Allows the Connector to describe which types of objects the Connector manages on the target resource. This includes the options supported for each type of object.
* **TestOp** - Allows testing of the resource configuration to verify that the target environment is available.
* **SearchOp** - Allows the connector to search the Zoom Web Service for resource objects.
* **CreateOp** - Allows the connector to create Users or Groups
* **DeleteOp** - Allows the connector to delete Users, or Groups
* **UpdateDeltaOp** - Allows for updates of the supported Object Types. These are Users and Groups


## Deep Get Explained

The connector supports a **deep get** functionality which returns detailed information for each item returned from a query. This feature is necessary because a query may return partial fields for a record.This is the case with the Zoom User lookup and the lookup API calls. **Deep get** is invoked when the query contains paging parameters such as page size and page offset. **Deep get is recommended to be true for this connector.**


## Deep Import Explained

The connector’s deep import option is similar to the deep get option. The deep import option is invoked when a query does not have paging parameters. **Deep Import is recommended to be true for this connector.**


## Duplicate Record Returns Id Explained

The duplicate record returns Id configuration option is invoked when an HTTP POST request, used to create a record, returns HTTP 409 (Conflict). This typically indicates that the record we are attempting to create already exists. When this option is true the connector will attempt to get the record by name and return the record’s ID value to the caller. In this way a record can be seamlessly imported when it already exists on the target server. Unfortunately the Zoom API does not return HTTP 409 instead it returns HTTP 412. Because this is the case the connector will always do a lookup for an existing object type before creating the type.

## Email Address Changes

The Zoom API does not allow an email address to be changed once the user is created unless you have Managed Domains enabled. 
You enable this through Account Management. The connector will fail gracefully with an error message in the log. 
If more than 3 attempts are made to change a user's address within a 24 hour period, the Zoom API will return a rate limiting error (HTTP 429).
